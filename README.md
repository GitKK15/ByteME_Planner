# ByteME_Planner

Many students struggle with managing their time effectively and keeping track of tasks, deadlines, or study schedules. They often rely on scattered notes, reminders on their phones, or manual planners that donâ€™t adapt to their needs. As a result, they miss deadlines, feel overwhelmed, and perform below their potential. Even existing productivity apps are either too complicated, filled with unnecessary features, or not tailored to student-specific challenges like managing assignments, exams, and personal goals.

Implemented our idea and created a website. Will be creating a app based on it
